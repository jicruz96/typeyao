## **TL;DR**
* `typeyao`
  * ... is a dataclass-flavored library similar to `pydantic` and `dataclasses`.
  * ... can be used as an in-memory database, which is nice for prototyping.
  * ... handles nested data better.
  * ... validates data types better than `dataclasses`, but not as well as `pydantic`.
  * ... doesn't coerce data like `pydantic` does.
  * ... is pronounced "type-yao" (like "type-yow").
* You're probably better off using `pydantic` anyways since it's much better supported by the Python ecosystem, so use `typeyao` at your own risk.

See the [FAQ](#faq) for more details.


## Requirements
* Python 3.10+

## Install

`typeyao` is not yet available on PyPI. Check out the [contributing](#contributing) section to see how you can install it for development.



## Usage

#### Use `typeyao` the same way you would use `dataclasses` or `pydantic`:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>


```python
# inside some .py file...
from typeyao import Model

class Person(Model):
    name: str

Person(name="J.I.")  # ‚úÖ nice
Person(name=1)  # üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è InvalidModelError
```

`Person(name=1)` will raise a helpful `InvalidModelError` that resembles a JSON Schema validation error:

```json
{
    "name": "The value 1 of type <class 'int'> must be of type <class 'str'>"
}
```

</details>

#### You can also use it as an in-memory database. Read more about that in the ["Why `typeyao`?"](#why-typeyao) section of the [FAQ](#faq).


## FAQ


### Why `typeyao`?

> **TL;DR** -- you wanted to use `dataclasses` or `pydantic` but they sucked at a specific thing, or you _really_ want one of `typeyao`'s exclusive features (click below).

#### In-memory database


If you want to prototype a web application quickly and don't want to deal with the overhead of setting up a database, you can use `typeyao` as an in-memory database, using your models as access points to your data. See an example below.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `typeyao` doesn't support any kind of persistence (_yet!_). All data created at runtime will be lost when the program exits. If you want to persist your data, you should use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) like [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```python
from typeyao import Model, Field

class Person(Model):
    name: str = Field(primary_key=True)
    family_name: str

for first_name in ["Snap", "Crackle", "Pop"]:
    Person(name=name, family_name="Krispies")

snap = Person.get(name="Snap")
print(snap.name) # Snap
rice_family = Person.filter(family_name="Krispies")
print([person.name for person in rice_family]) # ["Snap", "Crackle", "Pop"]
```
</details>



#### Better error messages

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Copy/paste the snippet below into a file and run it to see the difference in error messages between `dataclasses`, `pydantic`, and `typeyao`.

```python
import dataclasses
import pydantic
import typeyao

@dataclasses.dataclass
class DataClassPerson:
    name: str
    age: int
    sex: str

class PydanticPerson(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    sex: str

class TypeyaoPerson(typeyao.Model):
    name: str
    age: int
    sex: str

# this won't fail, but it should have
DataClassPerson(name="J.I.", age="Age is a construct", sex=1)

# this fails
try:
    PydanticPerson(name="J.I.", age="Age is a construct", sex=1)
except pydantic.ValidationError as e:
    print(f"---- Pydantic Error Message ----")
    print(e, end="\n\n")

# this fails, but with a slightly better error message
try:
    TypeyaoPerson(name="J.I.", age="Age is a construct", sex=1)
except typeyao.base.InvalidModelError as e:
    print(f"---- Typeyao Error Message ----")
    print(e, end="\n\n")
```

The above snippet will print:
```
---- Pydantic Error Message ----
1 validation error for PydanticPerson
age
  value is not a valid integer (type=type_error.integer)

---- Typeyao Error Message ----

{
    "age": "The value 'Age is a construct' of type <class 'str'> must be of type <class 'int'>",
}

```

#### Model-aware defaults.

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Let's say you have the model below:

```python
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    is_adult: bool
```

and you want `is_adult` to depend on the value of `age`. With `typeyao`, you can do this:

```python
from typeyao import Model

class Person(Model):
    name: str
    age: int
    is_adult: bool

    def set_is_adult(self) -> bool:
        return self.age >= 18
```

> **Note to Beginners:**
> If you're a python beginner, you probably want to look at `@property` decorators before you use this feature. `@property` decorators are more "pythonic". _But_ properties are computed every time you access them, and properties won't be a part of the data model's schema. So if it's expensive to compute the property or if you want that property to be a part of the model schema, you should use `typeyao`'s `set_<attribute_name>` method.

`pydantic` can handle this edge case via `@validator`, and `dataclasses` via `__post_init__`, but both of those solutions are a bit clunky (see below).

<details>

<summary>See how **pydantic** does it</summary>


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    is_adult: bool

    @validator("is_adult")
    def set_is_adult(cls, v, values):
        return values["age"] >= 18
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>See how **dataclasses** does it</summary>

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    is_adult: bool = False # default is required

    def __post_init__(self):
        # and the post_init can override the default
        self.is_adult = self.age >= 18
```

### Why not `dataclasses` ?

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### There are better options

`pydantic` is a great library that does everything `dataclasses` does, and more. The only reason you might want to use `dataclasses` is if you're using a version of python that doesn't support `pydantic` (e.g. python 3.6) or if you don't want to add a dependency to your project.

#### `dataclasses` doesn't validate your data.

```python

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str

p = Person(name=1)  # No error!
```

#### `dataclasses` sucks at inheritance.

Since `dataclasses` require that the attribute order be the same as the `__init__` order, it's impossible to create subclasses with additional attributes.


```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    birthday: datetime | None = None

@dataclass
class Employee(Person):
    employee_id: int

# Raises TypeError: non-default argument 'employee_id' follows default argument
e = Employee(name="J.I.", employee_id="1") 
```

</details>

### Why not `pydantic`?

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**You *should* use [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)**, unless you already know why it wouldn't work. It is a much better supported library.

But here a few reasons you may prefer `typeyao` over `pydantic`.

#### `typeyao` handles nested data structures better than `pydantic`

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pydantic import BaseModel as Model


class NestedStructure(Model):
    parent: NestedStructure | None = None


root = NestedStructure()
child1 = NestedStructure(parent=root)
child2 = NestedStructure(parent=root)

assert child1.parent == child2.parent == root  # passes
# you'd expect the following assertion to pass as well, but it's not
# because pydantic is doing some funny business under the hood
assert child1.parent is child2.parent is root  

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/main.py", line 13, in <module>
    assert child1.parent is child2.parent is root
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

Switch out the `pydantic` import in the previous snippet with `from typeyao import Model` and the assertion will pass üéâ.

</details>

#### `pydantic` coerces your data. `typeyao` does not.

Type coercion is fantastic for some use cases, but very annoying when you didn't ask for it (see example below).

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```python

import pydantic
import typeyao

class Person(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str

me = Person(name=1)  # no error! the 1 is coerced into a string
print(me.name)  # '1'

class Person(typeyao.Model):
    name: str

me = Person(name=1)  # raises a typeyao.base.InvalidModelError
```
</details>

</details>

### What does `typeyao` mean?


It's an homage to the author's home island, Puerto Rico.

The package name `typeyao` is the phonetic spelling of how a Puerto Rican would say the word "typed".

Example:
> **English:** "These models need to be explicitly typed."
> 
> **Puerto Rican:** "Esos modelos tienen que estar 'type'iao s√≠ o s√≠."
